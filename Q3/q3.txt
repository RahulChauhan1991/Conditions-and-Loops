Loops in JavaScript are used to execute a block of code a number of times.
The different types of loops in JavaScript:
1)For Loop: This loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The syntax is as follows:

for (initialization; condition; afterthought) {
  // code block to be executed
}
2)While Loop: This loop continues to run as long as the specified condition is true. The syntax is as follows:

while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
3)Do/While Loop: This loop will first execute the code block once, then it will repeat the loop as long as the specified condition is true. The syntax is as follows:

let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
while (i < 5);
