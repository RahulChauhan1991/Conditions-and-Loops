Q. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.
Ans. Conditional statements in javascript execute a piece of code based on whether a condition is true or false.
There are three types of conditional statements in javascript-
1)If Statement- Executes a block of code if the condition evaluates to true.If the condition evaluates to false the block of code inside the paranthesis is skipped.
SYNTAX-
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
2)If else Statement-If you want to execute a block of code if the condition evaluates to false then use If else statement.
SYNTAX-
// if...else statement
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}

// if...else if...else statement
if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
3)Switch Statement-used to select one of many blocks of code based on the value of a variable.It is a good alternative to if...else...if chain if it runs too long.It uses the strict equality operator(===) to compare the variable with the case value. 
SYNTAX-
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Statements executed when the result of expression matches value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Statements executed when the result of expression matches value2
    break;
  ...
  default:
    // Statements executed when none of the values match the value of the expression
}
